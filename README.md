I am developing a proof of concept (POC) for handling forms in a web application using the Remix framework, which is based on React Router. My goal is to leverage native web APIs as much as possible for form management while working in a modern development environment that includes React, Vite, and TypeScript.

Key Objectives:

1. Native Form Handling:
Utilize built-in HTML form functionalities, such as input validation via HTML5 attributes (required, pattern, etc.), and ensure robust support for accessibility and usability.

2. Form Data Processing:
Use the FormData API for retrieving and managing form input values on both the client and server sides. This approach avoids additional dependencies and embraces web standards.

3. Minimal Dependency on React:
While using React, I aim to limit its role to non-critical aspects of the application, such as rendering error notifications or enhancing the UI. React should not manage form state or submission logic but can be utilized for user feedback and error display.

4. Integration with Remix:
Implement data submission and retrieval logic through Remix’s actions (for handling POST, PUT, and DELETE requests) and loaders (for fetching data on the server side). These should seamlessly integrate with the form components.

5. Progressive Enhancement:
Start with a fully functional server-side rendered application that uses forms which degrade gracefully without client-side JavaScript. Enhance the forms with JavaScript as needed to improve user experience (e.g., input focus management, animations for error messages).

6. Modern Environment:
Build the POC using modern tooling:

React: Primarily for UI rendering and progressive enhancement.
Vite: As the development and build tool for optimized performance.
TypeScript: To ensure type safety and maintainability throughout the application.


7. Scalability and Maintainability:
Adhere to Remix’s principles of modularity and separation of concerns. The solution should support nested routing, parallel data fetching, and efficient state management provided by the framework.

Goal:

The objective of this POC is to validate the feasibility and performance of using Remix for building scalable, web-standards-compliant forms while minimizing reliance on JavaScript frameworks and third-party libraries. The result should strike a balance between modern user experiences and adherence to web standards.
